# CaveNet
CaveNet is a Discord-Like application built on a custom protocol and written in C for easy porting.
This is my big record-breaker project. First time working in C or its derivatives, my first Wii Homebrew, and some day my first DS/3DS homebrew and first Macintosh 128k application.

This thang ain't anywhere near good at the moment, but it's close to functional!
