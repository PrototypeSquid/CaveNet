# CaveNet
CaveNet is a Discord-Like application built on a custom protocol and written in C for easy porting.
This is my big record-breaker project. First time working in C or its derivatives, my first Wii Homebrew, and some day my first DS/3DS homebrew and first Macintosh 128k application.

This thang ain't anywhere near good at the moment, but it's close to functional!

Note that if you would like to run a public instance of CaveNet, you are accepting the inherent risk of getting your network comprimised. As such, I advise running it on a VPS or other sort of cloud server, or at least on a seperate "guest network" if available.

Next steps for the project are building a GUI client, combining the Windows and Linux cli client and server, making sure images and gifs work, and final polish. After that, any legacy clients are fun bonuses.
